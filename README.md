# X-Insight

Project created by my team X Variables in the Skillsfuture Hackathon 2018 which won 3rd Place.

X-Insight is a lightweight package which enhances existing Learning Management Systems in understanding their viewers through Computer Vision and Sentiment Analysis. It adapts and improves content with sentiment data collected from the viewer's facial expressions throughout the video. Facial expressions are captured by webcam access on the platform and they are translated into sentiment data. This is then plotted to show how interest levels vary for the user throughout the video and a dashboard is built for content providers to analyse key metrics.
